# BankCPP
This program simulates a simple banking system using C++. It consists of two classes: Customer and Bank. The Customer class represents a bank customer and has attributes like name, account number, and balance. It provides functions to deposit and withdraw money from the customer's account. The Bank class represents a bank and stores a collection of Customer objects. It offers functionality to add customers and display their details.  

In the main function, the program creates an instance of the Bank class and adds several customers to it. It then displays the details of all customers. After that, some transactions like withdrawals and deposits are performed on individual customers. Finally, the updated customer details are displayed again.  

This program showcases concepts of object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and working with collections of objects. It demonstrates how multiple classes can interact to create a basic banking system simulation.
